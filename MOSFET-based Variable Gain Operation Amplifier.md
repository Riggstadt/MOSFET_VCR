# TO DO
For the time being building the VGA is canceled. 
# TO DO RAMP GENERATOR
- Build on perf board
- Replace PNP current source with JFET CCS
- Add low value resistor at drain
- Zener diode selection to minimize maximum VGS

Steps to follow:
- Test circuit for adequate ramp and range of values, lineariy even at VT and above [unloaded]
- as above [loaded]
- Current sense opamp circuit with JFET current source load
- combine those above and test
