# MOSFET-based Voltage Controlled Resistor
MOSFETs are a type of Field Effect Transistors (FETs) frequently used for load switching and signal amplification. 
Besides the aforementioned use cases, there exists a third possible use case: Voltage Controlled Resistors (VCRs). 
This use case requires driving the FET into the deep triode region.

VCRs can be useful on their own, as part of voltage dividers, but their usefulness can be greatly enhanced by using them to craft Amplifiers with Voltage Controlled Gain.
